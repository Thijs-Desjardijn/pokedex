#pokedex

This is a pokedex CLI that has all the basics such as catching logic, storing the Pokémon in a pokedex, reviewing the pokemons in your pokedex and a lot more.

## Installation 

These instructions are for a Linux-based system.

First of all, make sure you have go installed using: 
```bash 
go version
```
If not, go to the [Go installation page](https://go.dev/doc/install) and install go.

After this make sure you have git installed using:
```bash
git version
```
if not, go to the [git instalation page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and install git.

Now you can simply initialize a git environment and use a pull request to get the pokedex:
```bash
git init
git pull https://github.com/Thijs-Desjardijn/pokedex
```

## Usage

To use a command simply type the command name after you see "Pokedex >".

You can view all the commands that are available using the "help" command. Some commands require an extra part of the command like an area or a Pokémon name.
